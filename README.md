## Data Transformation Modeller

The data transformation modeller is a tool to help you document the requriements to map data from one complex format to another in a technology agnostic way.

We all know that once you are working with complex data formats its very challenging to document the mapping of data from one format to another when the data could be in nested parent/child structures.  Tools like excel and word and other common tools just cant handle these cases.

The data transformation modeller will help to model these structures and create document the transformation rules as a business analyst and then communicate them to a developer in a way they can use them effectively to build the transformation code in whatever technology they prefer to use.
